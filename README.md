Learning ethical hacking by coding basic tools with python

=> I've see that the best way to learn ethical hacking is starting from basics, 
   by coding it's basics tools from scratch with python.

=> I am learning to secure my computers, and my web services.

=> Using the built-in tools in different OSs without knowing what is going in the
   background,  will not be good for future purposes like creating my own tool 
   later.
   
=> Learning to code this tools will develop my logic, information in networks,
   and coding network tools.
   
=> I am in the learning process so this repo is not completed or efficient in great way.

=> This tools works fine on kali linux, on some OSs will not work on it.

=> This tools are created for only learning purposes, using it in harmful way,
   will be on your responsibility.
